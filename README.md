# EasyCrypt-AES
AES-256 version of EasyCrypt
<br>
This is a stronger version of the old EasyCrypt tool.
<br>
To run it, first run generatekey.py to generate an AES-256 key. And then you can run easycrypt.py to encrypt and decrypt files :)
<br>
If you have issues running EasyCrypt, please let me know.
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> You cannot only download easycrypt.py or any other files. You will need the classes.py file in the same directory for EasyCrypt to run correctly.
<br>
<b>EasyCrypt AES Edition uses AES-256 in CFB mode</b>
